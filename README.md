# Unity-Cartoon-Android-Shooter
This is a small project where I'll be creating a 2D Android game using Unity. This game was created over the course of a week and was my first attempt at creating an entire game and publishing it. 

I learned a lot about programming and creating a game during this project and I hope that you will all check out Awesome Aerial Assault on the Google Play store!
